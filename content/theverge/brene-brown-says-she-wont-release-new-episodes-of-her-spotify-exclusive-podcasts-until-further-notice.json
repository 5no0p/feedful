Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903354/spotify-joe-rogan-removing-neil-young-music\">Spotify removed Young’s music</a> after the singer asked the platform to choose between him and Rogan. Mitchell’s departure from Spotify came shortly after, who says she stands “in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities.”</p><p id=\"s2eUC5\">Bruce Springsteen guitarist <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/30/bruce-springsteen-guitarist-nils-lofgren-joins-spotify-boycott-.html\">Nils Lofgren joined the Spotify boycott</a> as well and has since removed his music from the platform. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60191264\">reportedly expressed their concerns about misinformation on Spotify</a> — the couple <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-spotify-podcasts-1234853387/\">signed an exclusive deal with Spotify in 2020</a>.</p><p id=\"WFBFpM\">The <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em> is the subject of <a href=\"https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/\">an open letter</a> signed off on by dozens of medical and scientific professionals who believe the podcast spreads “misleading and false claims” about COVID-19 vaccines, and plead with Spotify to develop a COVID-19 misinformation policy. In an internal memo viewed by <em>The Verge</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22907069/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-covid-19-moderation-policies\">Spotify says none of Rogan’s episodes “meet the threshold for removal.”</a> The company struck a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814\">$100 million deal with Rogan in 2020</a>, and since experiencing such high-profile dropouts from the platform, its market capitalization <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/spotify-2-billion-market-cap-neil-young-joe-rogan-1235166798/\">fell by about $2.1 billion</a> in the span of three days.</p>",
