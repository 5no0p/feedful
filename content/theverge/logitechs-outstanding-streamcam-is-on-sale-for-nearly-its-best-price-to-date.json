While some of us on the East Coast may be busy shoveling snow this Saturday morning, we hope many of you are having a restful weekend chock-full of deals and discounts.</p><p id=\"dOdCKa\">Kicking things off on the deals front is Logitech’s StreamCam, which is currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0855K66TJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale in its graphite colorway at Amazon for $108</a>. That’s about $62 off the regular price of this excellent webcam, one we consider to be the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera\">best webcam you can buy</a> in terms of image quality. The StreamCam is Logitech’s flagship 1080p camera and is able to achieve 60 frames per second, allowing for a smooth, crisp look. The Capture software can also keep you centered in the frame, much like the Center Stage feature found on Apple’s newer iPads, and the compact webcam can record in either landscape or portrait mode, a feature that makes editing clips for mobile that much easier. It doesn’t go on sale too frequently, however, and today’s price is only a few dollars shy of its all-time low. </p><aside id=\"2qPYOc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Logitech’s new stream light is an affordable, convenient alternative to Elgato\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879811/logitech-litra-glow-elgato\"},{\"title\":\"I refuse to care about the quality of my webcam \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"cwXSUc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10730585\"></div></div><p id=\"4mtXo0\">The Beats Fit Pro are a new dark horse in the world of true wireless earbuds. While these days we often associate Apple-owned Beats with fitness-focused alternatives to the de facto standard AirPods line, the ANC-equipped Beats Fit Pro offer a comfy fit and outclass the pricier AirPods Pro in audio quality. Their only downsides are a clunkier case that does not offer wireless charging, and their tendency to not go on sale as much as the AirPods Pro. Well, that and the fact they still work a bit more seamlessly with iOS than Android.</p><p id=\"rkFdkt\">Today, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QPDRKK7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beats Fit Pro with a $20 gift card at Amazon for $199.99</a>, the full retail price. That may not be as good as last week’s raw sale, which saw the earbuds discounted to $153, but it’s a solid deal nonetheless. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"u2Uxyc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10844241\"></div></div><p id=\"sZFpKq\">The Roborock S6 MaxV is a robot vacuum and mop with a solid feature set that includes AI-based obstacle avoidance, up to 180 minutes of runtime, programmable no-go zones, and integration with Amazon’s Alexa. Roborock’s top-of-the-line model normally sells for $750, but it’s currently discounted to $460 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084Z5JD5Q?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoborock-S6-MaxV-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaner-with-Reactive-AI-and-Intelligent-Mopping-Lidar-Navigation%2F964601076&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals012922\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> (be sure to clip the on-page coupon on Amazon). </p><p id=\"ly78XW\">We have not tested this exact model, but our resident smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22901270/roborock-s7-plus-robot-vacuum-and-mop-review\">recently found a lot to like in its flagship counterpart</a>, the Roborock S7 Plus. The latter vacuum sells for $950, so the S6 MaxV promises many of the same features — suction capacity, lidar navigation, tank size, etc. — for almost half the price. The S6 lacks the auto-empty dock found on the S7 Plus, but if your home is littered with toys and other potential obstacles, the MaxV might be the better bet.</p><aside id=\"a4VqYs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22901270/roborock-s7-plus-robot-vacuum-and-mop-review\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"Wf1GbL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11001486\"></div></div><p id=\"6FOiED\">If you’re a PC gamer, the two biggest digital storefronts are both offering discounts worthy of your perusal right now.
