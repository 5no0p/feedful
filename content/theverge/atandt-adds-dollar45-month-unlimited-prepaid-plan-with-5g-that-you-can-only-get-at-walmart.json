This includes its 15GB plan for $35 / month instead of $40, as well as its 5GB plan for $25 / month instead of $30. The company notes that customers who qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) can use up to $30 of their subsidy to pay for AT&amp;T’s prepaid plan, making the 5GB plan free if the subsidy is applied.</p><p id=\"VOoW4l\">In addition, the carrier is also offering prepaid phones at a discount, including the Motorola Moto G Pure for $19 (compared to $69), the Samsung Galaxy A03s for $29 (compared to $79), Samsung Galaxy A12 for $69 (compared to $119), iPhone SE for $149 (compared $249), and the iPhone 11 for $299 (compared to $399). The discounted prices for the iPhone SE and iPhone 11 require customers to activate the Unlimited Max plan in Walmart, while the rest of the discounts apply when customers activate any monthly AT&amp;T prepaid plan in Walmart.</p><p id=\"tQOIoI\">AT&amp;T also has three 5G devices available at Walmart, but they don’t come with a discount: the AT&amp;T Radiant Max 5G ($149), Motorola One 5G Ace ($199), and the Samsung Galaxy A13 5G ($199).</p><aside id=\"N5oylp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"AT&amp;amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408326/att-mobile-internet-hotspot-prepaid-plan-5g\"}]}'></div></aside>",
