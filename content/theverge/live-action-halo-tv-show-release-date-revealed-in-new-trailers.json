At around the 52-second mark, you can hear the announcer state the fast-approaching release date.</p><div id=\"JXddwH\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Find the Halo, win the war.

This is a much meatier trailer than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783546/halo-tv-show-paramount-plus-live-action-teaser-trailer\">brief</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826806/halo-tv-show-live-action-trailer-2022-game-awards-master-chief\">trailers</a> released last year, and gives us a more detailed glimpse at the possible storyline — which doesn’t seem to follow any specific arcs from the games themselves. We also get a first look at Master Chief’s AI assistant, Cortana, as well as the Elites.</p><p id=\"8P26tv\">The <em>Halo</em> show stars Pablo Shreiber of <em>American Gods </em>as Master Chief, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561137/halo-tv-show-cortana-recast-jen-taylor\">Jen Taylor taking on the familiar role</a> of Cortana, who she voiced since the release of the first <em>Halo</em> game in 2001. Natasha McElhone, who was originally cast to play Cortana, will star as the brilliant Dr. Catherine Halsey.</p><p id=\"D2bo4O\">The live-action <em>Halo</em> was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514578/halo-tv-series-showtime-microsoft-xbox\">first announced in 2018 as a Showtime</a> series, but later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299828/halo-tv-show-paramount-plus-exclusive-showtime-microsoft\">became a Paramount Plus exclusive</a>. And while it was originally set to debut in 2021, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic pushed back the show’s release date until 2022.</p><div id=\"5miP7X\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11004084\"></div></div><p id=\"va2o4m\"><em><strong>Update January 30th 4:40PM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated to add an additional trailer released by Paramount Plus, as well as photos from the Halo TV show.</em></p>",
