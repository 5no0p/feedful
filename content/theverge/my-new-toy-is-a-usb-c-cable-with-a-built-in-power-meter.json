You can now buy $20 USB-C cables that come complete with their own wattage meter, letting you see just how fast they’re charging your devices. </p><p id=\"GIFXLw\">I bought mine a month ago — it took its sweet time getting here — but so far, I’m impressed! For the past couple of days, I’ve been plugging it into everything to see how much it draws: 18W for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements\">my V2 Nintendo Switch</a>, 30-31W for my <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features\">DJI Mini 2 drone</a>, 2.5-3W for one of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture\">my PS5’s DualSense controllers</a>, 54-65W for my XPS 15, all the way up to 99W for a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\">14-inch M1 MacBook Pro</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866022/skydio-2-plus-drone-keyframe-free-update-price-specs-release\">Skydio 2</a> drone. Or, down to 0.5W while trickle-charging the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22787814/wyze-buds-pro-review-earbuds-headphones-audio-price\">Wyze Buds Pro</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4sJlCSAwiaOekhiTgDZJZKPVGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23202870/sean_hollister_20220128_144932.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Why a leaf? It was there, it looked pretty.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"ZMrNbY\">On Amazon, the cables are largely sold by an alphabet-soup collection of brands like “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/WOTOBEUS-Display-Charging-480Mbps-Thunderbolt/dp/B09D7F9MQ3/ref=sr_1_4?crid=37ZCYEPU1OFJ2&amp;keywords=usb+c+power+meter+cable&amp;qid=1643411076&amp;sprefix=usb+c+power+meter+cabl%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-4&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WOTOBEUS</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/URVNS-Display-Charging-Braided-MacBook/dp/B09747KND4/ref=sr_1_5?crid=37ZCYEPU1OFJ2&amp;keywords=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter%2Bcable&amp;qid=1643411076&amp;sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter%2Bcabl%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">URVNS</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CHIPOFY-Display-Marker-Charging-Transmission/dp/B09KLYBS5H/ref=sr_1_19?crid=37ZCYEPU1OFJ2&amp;keywords=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter%2Bcable&amp;qid=1643411095&amp;sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter%2Bcabl%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-19&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CHIPOFY”</a>, but the one I bought feels surprisingly high-quality despite that. The tiny teal screen and shiny reversible connectors are set in a metal head, connected to to a decent-quality braided cable with what feels like a reasonable amount of strain relief — though I haven’t tested its “35,000+ bend lifespan” quite yet. </p><p id=\"ft84AK\">What I <em>did</em> test is its ability to measure power, plugging it into literally every USB-C device my family owns, including an array of chargers. Using a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kill-A-Watt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Voltage-Amperage-MacBook-Spectre/dp/B01NAWYSVK/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a separate, detachable USB-C power meter</a> as the baseline, I checked both its accuracy and whether it could charge my devices properly, compared to other cables.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p-AD4nsqku63vRCHF1rUC9_3snc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23202869/sean_hollister_20220128_145336.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>My old detachable USB-C power meter is a bit more... bricklike than even the new standalones you can buy today.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"JjqUbV\">In most cases, it was right on the money, with a few important caveats:</p><ul><li id=\"66mgdZ\">It <em>only</em> shows watts, not volts and amps. It’s a handy shortcut, but you can learn more from standalone USB-C testers <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/diymore-Charging-Multimeter-Digital-Voltmeter/dp/B096WYWZ16/ref=sr_1_19?crid=1R0ZANIGLM6JE&amp;keywords=usb+c+power+meter&amp;qid=1643411208&amp;sprefix=usb+c+power+meter%2Caps%2C101&amp;sr=8-19&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that cost as little as $11</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MakerHawk-Multimeter-Multi-function-Capacity-Detector/dp/B07GQLYMR9/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1R0ZANIGLM6JE&amp;keywords=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter&amp;qid=1643411208&amp;sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bpower%2Bmeter%2Caps%2C101&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$17</a> now.</li><li id=\"hq1RFU\">You’ve gotta plug the screen end into the thing you’re charging if you want a measurement. It’ll still charge the other way, but the meter isn’t bidirectional.</li><li id=\"84FWSs\">For some reason, a few combinations of cable and charger had wacky results: the 14-inch MacBook Pro wouldn’t charge <em>at all</em> from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18410552/laptop-portable-batteries-high-wattage-usb-c-charger\">my 100W HyperJuice USB-C battery pack</a> when using this cable, even though it charged just fine if I swapped out the battery for an adapter or this cable for a different cable. </li><li id=\"Ks6Bke\">The DJI Mini 2 also wouldn’t charge at full speed with this cable and one of my four USB-C adapters, even though it worked fine with the other three adapters and my 100W battery.</li><li id=\"6AhmAJ\">My cheapo USB-C to Lightning adapter didn’t work with this cable, so I wasn’t able to test it with an iPhone. But I had no such trouble with one of the standalone USB-C testers and an official Apple USB-C to Lightning charge cable.</li></ul><p id=\"Nu8kw4\">The biggest caveat, though, is that this is <strong>NOT</strong> a high-speed data cable; it’s only suitable for high-speed charging. The transfer rate tops out at the old USB 2.0 speed of 480 Mbps, a far cry from the 5Gbps or 10Gbps you can get with USB 3.1. With a good short SuperSpeed cable, I was able to transfer a 5GB file to my PC from an external SSD in just 17 seconds. This charge cable took a full two minutes longer (2:17) to complete the same task, bottlenecked to just 40MB / second.</p><p id=\"i3mTPq\">That seems to be a limitation of these early cables, unfortunately, as all of them advertise that low speed — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/j5create-USB-C-Dynamic-Power-Charging/dp/B0868S782Z/ref=sr_1_3?crid=37ZCYEPU1OFJ2&amp;keywords=usb+c+power+meter+cable&amp;qid=1643411076&amp;sprefix=usb+c+power+meter+cabl%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">even this new bidirectional j5create one</a> that adds some other handy features onscreen. Meanwhile, the standalone USB-C power meter I bought several years ago lets me transfer data at full speed without issues.</p><p id=\"hUColZ\">None of that’s quite enough to sour me on this cable, because I didn’t have a nice, long charge cable capable of both USB 3 data rates and 100W charging to begin with, and I appreciate not needing to keep track of a meter dongle anymore. I’m fine just using it for charging and pairing a different cable with my SSD. But if you’re truly a USB-C PD connoisseur, I’d probably suggest you pick a standalone meter instead. </p><p id=\"wLJzJH\"></p>",
