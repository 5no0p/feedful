In a nearly ten-minute video uploaded to Instagram, Rogan defends his decision to book contentious guests, apologizes to Spotify for the backlash, and details how the podcast may change in the future.</p><p id=\"Q8Dxnp\">“These podcasts are very strange because they’re just conversations,” Rogan says. “And oftentimes I have no idea what I’m going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people. And that’s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I’m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and they’re just conversations, and I think that’s also the appeal of the show. It’s one of the things that makes it interesting. So I want to thank Spotify for being so supportive during this time, and I’m very sorry that this is happening to them and that they’re taking so much from it.”</p><aside id=\"r0z3q5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Neil Young says he ‘felt better’ after leaving Spotify and its ‘shitty’ sound quality\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906722/neil-young-spotify-sound-quality-amazon-apple-music\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"NRAUZA\">Rogan mentions two podcast guests that much of the controversy has focused on, Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Robert Malone. <a href=\"https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/joe-rogan-interview-with-peter-mccullough-contains-multiple-false-and-unsubstantiated-claims-about-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-vaccines/\">Both</a> of these <a href=\"https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/robert-malone-misleading-unsubstantiated-claims-covid-19-safety-efficacy-vaccines-joe-rogan-experience-spotify-podcast/\">guests</a> made multiple unsubstantiated claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, according to fact-checking organization Science Feedback. Rogan says of the guests that they are “highly credentialed, very intelligent, very accomplished people, and they have an opinion that is different from the mainstream narrative. I wanted to hear what their opinion is.”</p><div id=\"ZmBH1n\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZYQ_nDJi6G/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" ><div > <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZYQ_nDJi6G/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\"> <div > <div ></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div><div ></div> <div ><svg width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\" viewbox=\"0 0 60 60\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"https://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><g transform=\"translate(-511.000000, -20.000000)\" fill=\"#000000\"><g><path d=\"M556.869,30.41 C554.814,30.41 553.148,32.076 553.148,34.131 C553.148,36.186 554.814,37.852 556.869,37.852 C558.924,37.852 560.59,36.186 560.59,34.131 C560.59,32.076 558.924,30.41 556.869,30.41 M541,60.657 C535.114,60.657 530.342,55.887 530.342,50 C530.342,44.114 535.114,39.342 541,39.342 C546.887,39.342 551.658,44.114 551.658,50 C551.658,55.887 546.887,60.657 541,60.657 M541,33.886 C532.1,33.886 524.886,41.1 524.886,50 C524.886,58.899 532.1,66.113 541,66.113 C549.9,66.113 557.115,58.899 557.115,50 C557.115,41.1 549.9,33.886 541,33.886 M565.378,62.101 C565.244,65.022 564.756,66.606 564.346,67.663 C563.803,69.06 563.154,70.057 562.106,71.106 C561.058,72.155 560.06,72.803 558.662,73.347 C557.607,73.757 556.021,74.244 553.102,74.378 C549.944,74.521 548.997,74.552 541,74.552 C533.003,74.552 532.056,74.521 528.898,74.378 C525.979,74.244 524.393,73.757 523.338,73.347 C521.94,72.803 520.942,72.155 519.894,71.106 C518.846,70.057 518.197,69.06 517.654,67.663 C517.244,66.606 516.755,65.022 516.623,62.101 C516.479,58.943 516.448,57.996 516.448,50 C516.448,42.003 516.479,41.056 516.623,37.899 C516.755,34.978 517.244,33.391 517.654,32.338 C518.197,30.938 518.846,29.942 519.894,28.894 C520.942,27.846 521.94,27.196 523.338,26.654 C524.393,26.244 525.979,25.756 528.898,25.623 C532.057,25.479 533.004,25.448 541,25.448 C548.997,25.448 549.943,25.479 553.102,25.623 C556.021,25.756 557.607,26.244 558.662,26.654 C560.06,27.196 561.058,27.846 562.106,28.894 C563.154,29.942 563.803,30.938 564.346,32.338 C564.756,33.391 565.244,34.978 565.378,37.899 C565.522,41.056 565.552,42.003 565.552,50 C565.552,57.996 565.522,58.943 565.378,62.101 M570.82,37.631 C570.674,34.438 570.167,32.258 569.425,30.349 C568.659,28.377 567.633,26.702 565.965,25.035 C564.297,23.368 562.623,22.342 560.652,21.575 C558.743,20.834 556.562,20.326 553.369,20.18 C550.169,20.033 549.148,20 541,20 C532.853,20 531.831,20.033 528.631,20.18 C525.438,20.326 523.257,20.834 521.349,21.575 C519.376,22.342 517.703,23.368 516.035,25.035 C514.368,26.702 513.342,28.377 512.574,30.349 C511.834,32.258 511.326,34.438 511.181,37.631 C511.035,40.831 511,41.851 511,50 C511,58.147 511.035,59.17 511.181,62.369 C511.326,65.562 511.834,67.743 512.574,69.651 C513.342,71.625 514.368,73.296 516.035,74.965 C517.703,76.634 519.376,77.658 521.349,78.425 C523.257,79.167 525.438,79.673 528.631,79.82 C531.831,79.965 532.853,80.001 541,80.001 C549.148,80.001 550.169,79.965 553.369,79.82 C556.562,79.673 558.743,79.167 560.652,78.425 C562.623,77.658 564.297,76.634 565.965,74.965 C567.633,73.296 568.659,71.625 569.425,69.651 C570.167,67.743 570.674,65.562 570.82,62.369 C570.966,59.17 571,58.147 571,50 C571,41.851 570.966,40.831 570.82,37.631\"></path></g></g></g></svg></div><div > <div >View this post on Instagram</div></div><div ></div> <div ><div> <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></a><p ><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZYQ_nDJi6G/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Joe Rogan (@joerogan)</a></p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></div><p id=\"V84UUa\">Despite the widespread debunking of many of the guests’ statements, Rogan takes issue with those episodes being labeled “misinformation.” He argues that the guests’ positions on certain subjects like the effectiveness of cloth masks, the origin of the virus, or whether vaccinated people could catch and spread COVID would have once got you “removed from social media” but have subsequently become accepted mainstream discourse. He doesn’t address their other claims.</p><p id=\"oj6Lql\">“I do not know if they’re right,” he continues. “I don’t know because I’m not a doctor. I’m not a scientist. I’m just a person who sits down and talks to people and has conversations with them. Do I get things wrong? Absolutely. I get things wrong, but I try to correct them whenever I get something wrong. I try to correct it because I’m interested in telling the truth. I’m interested in finding out what the truth is, and I’m interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I’m not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective.”</p><aside id=\"GIIoaV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Why Spotify can’t afford to lose Joe Rogan\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904463/joe-rogan-spotify-neil-young-decision-moderation-podcasts\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"GJ1Wxo\">While unrepentant about booking guests with disputed opinions, Rogan does say he’s open to ways in which the podcast could improve. He says he agrees with Spotify’s plan to label <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/30/22909432/spotify-covid-19-moderation-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation\">episodes that include COVID-19 discussion with content advisories and disclaimers</a>. He also says he wants to “have more experts with differing opinions, right after the controversial ones.”</p><p id=\"aXKzmN\">“I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people’s perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view,” he says. “I don’t want to just show the contrary opinion to what the narrative is. I want to show all kinds of opinions so we can all figure out what’s going on and not just about COVID, about everything, about health, about fitness, wellness, the state of the world itself.”</p><p id=\"VKZR8d\">Spotify reportedly struck a nine-figure deal with Rogan in 2020 for the rights to host his show exclusively. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22907069/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-covid-19-moderation-policies\">In documents seen by <em>The Verge</em></a>, the company deemed that multiple controversial <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em> episodes “didn’t meet the threshold for removal.” Last year <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19\"><em>The Verge </em>reported</a> that Spotify reviewed an episode where he advised 21 year olds not to get vaccinated and deemed it to be within the company’s content guidelines.</p>",
