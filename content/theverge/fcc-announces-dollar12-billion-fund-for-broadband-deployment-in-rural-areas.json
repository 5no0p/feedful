The FCC calls this “the largest funding round to date,” and notes 23 broadband companies will provide service to more than one million new areas.</p><p id=\"XHBZ61\">In addition, the FCC also <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-creates-rural-broadband-accountability-plan\">introduced the Rural Broadband Accountability Plan</a>, which will double the number of audits and verifications performed this year in comparison to 2021. It will also require the FCC to make the results of verifications, audits as well as speed and latency tests public on the <a href=\"https://www.usac.org/\">Universal Service Administration Company’s (USAC) website</a>.</p><div id=\"8VJLIn\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The new Rural Broadband Accountability Plan will streamline our audit and verification processes while also making the results of verifications, audits, and latency testing publicly available for the first time.

To help remedy the issue, President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate\">signed off on a $1 trillion infrastructure package</a> in November that allocates $65 billion to providing broadband to every American household.
