The advisory will lead to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/genre/corona_news_podcasts\">Spotify’s COVID-19 hub</a>, which contains credible and up-to-date information about the pandemic.</p><p id=\"ZU6CYo\">To increase transparency around its treatment of the issue, Spotify is making its <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotify-platform-rules/\">COVID-19 content policy</a> and general platform rules publicly available on its site. Spotify says anyone who breaks the rules may have the content in question removed, with repeat offenders potentially having their accounts suspended or banned. <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22907069/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-covid-19-moderation-policies\">obtained this policy ahead of the platform’s public release</a>, and an internal memo revealed that Joe Rogan’s podcast didn’t “meet the threshold for removal.”</p><aside id=\"PrGw4W\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Neil Young says he ‘felt better’ after leaving Spotify and its ‘shitty’ sound quality\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906722/neil-young-spotify-sound-quality-amazon-apple-music\"},{\"title\":\"Spotify is okay with Joe Rogan telling 21-year-olds not to get vaccinated \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"rpNVKB\">According to the policy, Spotify prohibits content that asserts “AIDS, COVID-19, cancer or other serious life threatening diseases are a hoax or not real.” The platform also bans content that encourages people “to purposely get infected with COVID-19 in order to build immunity” and doesn’t allow content that suggests vaccines “are designed to cause death.” However, compared to the document posted internally and viewed by <em>The Verge,</em> the wording on examples has changed, and one line is missing entirely. It specifically called out “Suggesting that wearing a mask will cause the wearer imminent, life-threatening physical harm.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"4VTy8l\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There’s been a lot of conversation about information regarding COVID-19 on Spotify.
