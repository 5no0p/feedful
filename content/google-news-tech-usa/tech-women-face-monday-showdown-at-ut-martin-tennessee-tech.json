  "description": "MARTIN, Tenn. – It’s another quick turnaround for the Tennessee Tech women as the Golden Eagles packed up on Sunday afternoon and headed to UT Martin for a Monday night contest.\n\nTipoff from the Elam Center is scheduled for 6 p.m. Dylan Vazzano will handle the broadcast for 106.1 The Eagle, while Chris Brinkley and Eddie Suiter will call the came for ESPN+ (subscription required).\n\nFollowing last weekend with a visit to Belmont then returning home to take on Eastern Illinois, the pattern is flip-flopped this week as the Golden Eagles are coming off of a thrilling victory over Austin Peay to stay in a tie at the top of the Ohio Valley Conference standings with Belmont and now taking on a UT Martin team that has been a challenging opponent in years past.",
