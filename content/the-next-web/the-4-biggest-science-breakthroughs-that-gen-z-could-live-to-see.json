Yesterday’s mainframes are today’s smartphones and today’s neural networks will be tomorrow’s androids. But long before any technology becomes reality, someone has to dream it into existence. The worlds of science and technology are constantly in flux. It’s impossible to tell what the future will bring. However we can make some educated guesses based on recent breakthroughs in the fields of nuclear physics, quantum computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, and… Facebook’s name change. Let’s set our time machines to “January 28, 2100” to take an imaginary gander at the four most&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/4-biggest-science-breakthroughs-that-gen-z-could-live-see?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
