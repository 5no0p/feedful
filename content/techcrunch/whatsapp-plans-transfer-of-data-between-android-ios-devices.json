However, the migration process would not be easy and would require both devices to have the app installed and would likely involve a wired or&nbsp; private WiFi connection. In comparison, other messaging apps store and sync user data with Google Drive, iCloud or their own cloud service.</span></p><p><span >&nbsp;WhatsApp recently added new features to its desktop and Android apps. The Android app will get new pencil and drawing&nbsp; tools in a future update, while WhatsApp Desktop will get new chat bubble colors. The desktop app&nbsp; also gets a new dark blue color that is only visible in dark theme mode.</span></p><p><span >The instant messaging app is also testing a new emoji message reaction info tab and new&nbsp; message reaction notification settings. WhatsApp feature tracker WABetaInfo said that WhatsApp is introducing new drawing tools to its Android app.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >You get two pens, including one thinner and one thicker than the existing pen.
